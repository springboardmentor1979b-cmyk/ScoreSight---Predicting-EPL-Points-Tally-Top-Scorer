# Week 6 – Advanced Models & Inference

## Objective
The objective of Week 6 was to improve model performance using advanced machine learning algorithms and test the models on unseen data.

## Tasks Performed
- Trained a Random Forest Regressor for player performance prediction.
- Applied hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Trained a Gradient Boosting Classifier for match outcome prediction.
- Compared baseline and advanced model performance.
- Saved trained models and performed inference on test data.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

## Key Observations
- Advanced models showed improved accuracy over baseline models.
- Hyperparameter tuning helped optimize model performance.
- Models generalized well on unseen test data.

## Conclusion
Advanced models and inference validated the robustness of the system and prepared the models for deployment in a user-facing application.
