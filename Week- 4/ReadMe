# 🏆 Week 4 – EPL Player Stats Scaling & Visualization

This week focuses on **scaling player statistics** and visualizing the data to better understand distributions and relationships between key metrics. The dataset used is the cleaned EPL player dataset from **Week 2**.

---

## 📂 Files

* `dataset - 2020-09-24.csv` – Raw dataset from Google Drive
* `minmax_scaled_epl.csv` – Dataset scaled using **Min-Max Scaler**
* `standard_scaled_epl.csv` – Dataset scaled using **Standard Scaler**
* `week3_scaling.ipynb` – Jupyter/Colab notebook containing preprocessing, scaling, and visualization steps

## 📝 Objectives

1. 🔹 Load the **EPL player dataset**.
2. 🔹 Check for missing values in key columns (`Goals`, `Appearances`, `Passes`).
3. 🔹 Apply **Min-Max Scaling** to normalize the range of features between 0 and 1.
4. 🔹 Apply **Standard Scaling** to standardize features with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.
5. 🔹 Visualize the relationship between `Appearances` and `Goals` before and after scaling.

## 🎯 Outcome

* Successfully **scaled numerical features** for better model performance.
* Visualized relationships between `Appearances` and `Goals` before and after scaling.
* Generated two **scaled datasets** ready for further ML modeling.
