📅 Week 4 – EPL Player Stats Scaling & Visualization
📂 Files Included

dataset - 2020-09-24.csv
Raw EPL player dataset stored in Google Drive

📊 minmax_scaled_epl.csv
Dataset scaled using Min-Max Scaler (range: 0–1)

📈 standard_scaled_epl.csv
Dataset scaled using Standard Scaler (mean = 0, std = 1)

🎯 Objectives

Load the EPL player dataset from Google Drive

Check and handle missing values in key numerical columns:

Appearances

Passes

Apply Min-Max Scaling to normalize feature ranges

Apply Standard Scaling to standardize features

Visualize relationships between Appearances and Goals:

Before scaling

After Min-Max scaling

🛠️ Methods Used

Min-Max Scaling

Scales features between 0 and 1

Useful when features have different ranges

Standard Scaling

Centers data around mean = 0

Scales data to unit variance

Suitable for algorithms like Linear Regression, SVM, and KNN

📊 Visualization

Scatter plots were created to observe the impact of scaling:

Before Scaling: Raw data distribution

After Scaling: Normalized feature distribution

These visualizations help verify that scaling preserves relationships while standardizing magnitudes.

✅ Outcome

Numerical features scaled successfully

Data distributions normalized and standardized

Visual confirmation of scaling effects

Scaled datasets ready for Week 5 – Model Building
