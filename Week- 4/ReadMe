🏆 Week 4 – EPL Player Stats Scaling & Visualization

📂 Files Included

📄 dataset - 2020-09-24.csv
Raw EPL player dataset stored in Google Drive

📊 minmax_scaled_epl.csv
Dataset scaled using Min-Max Scaler (range: 0–1)

📈 standard_scaled_epl.csv
Dataset scaled using Standard Scaler (mean = 0, std = 1)

📓 week3_scaling.ipynb
Jupyter/Google Colab notebook containing preprocessing, scaling, and visualizations

🎯 Objectives

🔹 Load the EPL player dataset from Google Drive

🔹 Check and handle missing values in key numerical columns

Goals

Appearances

Passes

🔹 Apply Min-Max Scaling to normalize feature ranges

🔹 Apply Standard Scaling to standardize features

🔹 Visualize relationships between Appearances and Goals

Before scaling

After Min-Max scaling

🛠️ Methods Used
🔸 Min-Max Scaling

Scales features between 0 and 1

Useful when features have different ranges

🔸 Standard Scaling

Centers data around mean = 0

Scales data to unit variance

Suitable for algorithms like Linear Regression, SVM, and KNN

📊 Visualization

Scatter plots were created to observe the impact of scaling:

Before Scaling: Raw data distribution

After Scaling: Normalized feature distribution

These visualizations help verify that scaling preserves relationships while standardizing magnitudes.

✅ Outcome

✔ Numerical features scaled successfully
✔ Data distributions normalized and standardized
✔ Visual confirmation of scaling effects
✔ Scaled datasets ready for Week 5 – Model Building
