# 📅 Week 6 – Advanced Models & Inference

### **Objective**

The objective of **Week 6** was to **enhance the predictive performance** of our machine learning models using advanced algorithms and to **validate the models on unseen data** to ensure they generalize well.

---

### **Tasks Performed**

* **Trained a Random Forest Regressor** for predicting **player performance (goals scored)**.
* **Applied hyperparameter tuning** using **GridSearchCV** to find the best parameters for model optimization.
* **Trained a Gradient Boosting Classifier** for predicting **match outcomes (Win / Draw / Loss)**.
* **Compared baseline and advanced model performance** to evaluate improvements.
* **Saved the trained models** (`.pkl` files) for later deployment.
* **Performed inference on test data** to check how models perform on unseen data.

---

### **Tools Used**

* **Python** – main programming language.
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation and preprocessing.
* **Scikit-learn** – for model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
* **Joblib** – to save and load trained models.
* **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – for coding and experimentation.

---

### **Key Observations**

* **Advanced models** (Random Forest Regressor & Gradient Boosting Classifier) showed **significantly improved accuracy** over baseline models.
* **Hyperparameter tuning** helped optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.
* Models were able to **generalize well** on unseen test data, indicating robustness.
* Predictions on sample data were **realistic and aligned with actual player and match statistics**.

### **Conclusion**

Week 6 focused on **model improvement and validation**.
The advanced models demonstrated **high reliability and robustness**, preparing them for **deployment in a user-facing application** in the following weeks.
This work laid the foundation for **end-to-end prediction** and **real-time inference** in the final AI ScoreSight app.
