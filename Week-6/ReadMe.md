# Week 3 – Player Performance & Match Outcome Prediction




### **Objective**

The objective of Week 3 was to leverage previously cleaned and scaled EPL player data to predict individual player performance (goals scored) and match outcomes using machine learning models.

### **Tasks Performed**

1. Loaded the preprocessed EPL dataset (`dataset - 2020-09-24.csv`) from Google Drive.
2. Imported previously trained models from Week 2:

   * Random Forest Regressor (`rf_regression_model.pkl`) for predicting player goals.
   * Gradient Boosting Classifier (`gb_classification_model.pkl`) for predicting match results.
3. Selected key features for predictions:

   * Regression features: `Appearances`, `Shots`, `Passes`, `Assists`.
   * Classification features: `Shots`, `Passes`, `Assists`.
4. Predicted:

   * `Predicted_Goals` for player performance.
   * `Predicted_Result` for match outcome (0 = No Goal, 1 = Single Goal, 2 = Multi Goals).
5. Verified predictions on sample data from the dataset.
6. Saved predictions in the dataset for further analysis.

### **Tools Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Joblib
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

### **Key Observations**

* Random Forest Regressor predicted goals with reasonable accuracy.
* Gradient Boosting Classifier successfully categorized match results.
* Sample inference showed realistic predictions based on player statistics.

### **Conclusion**

Week 3 focused on applying pre-trained models to new datasets to validate performance and perform inference. The workflow demonstrated the use of saved models for predictions without retraining, establishing a foundation for further model improvements and deployment in future weeks.
