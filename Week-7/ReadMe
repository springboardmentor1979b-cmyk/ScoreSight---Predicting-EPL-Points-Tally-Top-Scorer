# 📅 Week 7 – Full Application (GUI)

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of **Week 7** was to take the **trained machine learning models** from previous weeks and **deploy them into a user-friendly application** that allows **real-time predictions** for English Premier League (EPL) player performance and match outcomes.

The goal was to create a **complete end-to-end system**, from data to model predictions, accessible through a simple **graphical interface**.

## ⚡ Application Features

1. **Player Performance Prediction (Goals)**

   * Predict the expected number of goals a player will score.
   * Uses key player statistics such as **Appearances, Shots, Passes, and Assists**.
   * Instant feedback displayed in the interface.

2. **Match Outcome Prediction (Win / Draw / Loss)**

   * Predict the result of a match based on match-level statistics.
   * Uses features like **Shots, Passes, and Assists** to estimate **Win, Draw, or Loss**.

3. **Interactive GUI with Streamlit**

   * Easy-to-use interface for real-time predictions.
   * Separate tabs for **Player Performance** and **Match Outcome**.
   * Expandable sections explain the **model logic and guidance** to users.
   * Metrics and results are displayed clearly with **visual feedback** (success, warning, error).

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Python** – Core programming language
* **Streamlit** – For building the interactive GUI
* **Scikit-learn** – For machine learning models
* **Joblib** – To save and load trained models
* **VS Code** – Code editing and application development environment

## 📝 Implementation Details

* **Models Loading**:

  * Pre-trained models are stored as `.pkl` files in the `models/` folder.
  * **Random Forest Regressor** for player goal prediction.
  * **Gradient Boosting Classifier** for match outcome prediction.

* **User Input**:

  * Users enter player or match statistics directly into the GUI.
  * Input fields include numeric values like **Appearances, Shots, Passes, and Assists**.

* **Predictions**:

  * The models compute predictions in real-time.
  * Results are displayed instantly in a **clear and readable format**.

* **Application Layout**:

  * **Tabs** separate the two main functionalities:

    1. **Player Performance** – Predict goals.
    2. **Match Outcome** – Predict match result (Win/Draw/Loss).
  * **Expandable sections** provide model information, helping users understand how predictions are made.

## 🖼 Screenshots

Screenshots of the working application are available in the `screenshots/` folder:

* **Player Performance Tab** – Shows predicted goals for a player.
* **Match Outcome Tab** – Shows predicted result for a match.

## ✅ Conclusion

The Week 7 application demonstrates **end-to-end integration of machine learning models** into an interactive GUI.

* Users can now **predict player performance and match outcomes in real-time**.
* The interface is **user-friendly, intuitive, and visually informative**.
* This completes the **AI ScoreSight system**, combining data, machine learning, and application deployment for EPL analytics.
