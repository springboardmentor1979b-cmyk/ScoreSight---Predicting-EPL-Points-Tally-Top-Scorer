# Week 7 – Full Application (GUI)

## Objective

The objective of Week 7 was to deploy the trained machine learning models into a **user-friendly application** that allows **real-time predictions** for English Premier League (EPL) players and matches.

## Application Features

* **Player Performance Prediction (Goals)**: Predict the expected number of goals a player will score based on match statistics.
* **Match Outcome Prediction (Win / Draw / Loss)**: Predict the outcome of a match using key match statistics.
* **Interactive GUI**: Provides an easy-to-use interface built with **Streamlit** for instant predictions.

## Tools Used

* Python
* Streamlit
* Scikit-learn
* Joblib
* VS Code

## Implementation Details

* Pre-trained machine learning models are stored as `.pkl` files in the `models/` folder.
* User inputs for player and match statistics are collected via the Streamlit interface.
* Predictions are calculated using the loaded models and displayed instantly on the application interface.
* The interface includes two main tabs:

  1. **Player Performance** – Predict player goals.
  2. **Match Outcome** – Predict match results (Win, Draw, Loss).
* Additional information and model details are accessible through expandable sections for user guidance.

## Screenshots

Screenshots of the working application are available in the `screenshots/` folder.

* Player Performance Tab
* Match Outcome Tab

## Conclusion

The Week 7 application successfully integrates machine learning models into an **interactive, real-time interface**, completing the **end-to-end AI ScoreSight system** for EPL analytics.
