# Week 5 – Baseline Model Training

## Objective
The objective of Week 5 was to train baseline machine learning models for player performance prediction and match outcome classification.

## Tasks Performed
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained a Linear Regression model to predict player goals.
- Evaluated regression performance using MAE, RMSE, and R².
- Trained a Logistic Regression model for match outcome classification.
- Evaluated classification performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- Visualized model predictions and confusion matrix.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

## Key Observations
- Linear Regression provides a reasonable baseline for goal prediction.
- Classification performance indicates the need for more advanced models.
- Baseline models help establish a reference point for improvement.

## Conclusion
Baseline models were successfully trained and evaluated, forming a foundation for advanced modeling and optimization in the next week.
