# Week 4 – Feature Scaling

## Objective
The objective of Week 4 was to apply feature scaling techniques to ensure numerical features contribute equally during model training.

## Tasks Performed
- Printed raw values of key numerical features.
- Applied Min-Max Scaling to Goals, Appearances, Passes, and Assists.
- Applied Standardization (Z-score normalization) to Goals, Shots, and Passes.
- Compared feature distributions before and after scaling using scatter plots.
- Saved scaled datasets for future modeling.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

## Key Observations
- Feature scaling brought all values into a comparable range.
- Standardization centered features around zero with unit variance.
- Scaled data improves learning efficiency for ML models.

## Conclusion
Feature scaling was successfully applied, ensuring the dataset is properly prepared for training regression and classification models in the next phase.
