Week 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis


📊 Week 1 – Data Understanding & Exploratory Analysis
🎯 Objective

The objective of Week 1 was to understand the project problem statement and explore the English Premier League (EPL) player dataset that will be used for predicting match outcomes and player performance in later stages of the project.

📂 Dataset Overview

Source: EPL Player Performance Dataset (2020–2021 season)

Number of Records: 571 players

Number of Features: 59 columns

Data Type: Structured tabular data (CSV)

🛠️ Tasks Performed

Dataset Loading

Loaded the dataset using Python and Pandas.

Verified successful import from Google Drive.

Initial Exploration

Displayed top and bottom rows of the dataset.

Examined dataset shape, column names, and data types.

Checked memory usage and overall structure.

Descriptive Statistics

Generated summary statistics using describe().

Analyzed numerical features such as Goals, Assists, Appearances, Passes, and Age.

Categorical Analysis

Identified unique values for:

Clubs

Player Positions

Nationalities

Counted players by position (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Forward).

Performance Insights

Identified top goal-scoring players.

Analyzed goal distribution across different positions.

Missing Value Inspection

Checked null values across all columns.

Identified columns requiring cleaning and preprocessing in future weeks.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Google Colab

Google Drive

🔍 Key Observations

The dataset contains a mix of numerical and categorical features.

Certain performance metrics are position-specific (e.g., goalkeeper stats).

Several columns contain missing values, especially for specialized roles.

Goals, Assists, Appearances, and Passes are key performance indicators.

✅ Outcome

By the end of Week 1, a clear understanding of the dataset structure and feature relevance was achieved. This laid a strong foundation for data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning model development in subsequent weeks.

📌 Note:
All analysis was performed using Google Colab, with datasets accessed directly from Google Drive.
