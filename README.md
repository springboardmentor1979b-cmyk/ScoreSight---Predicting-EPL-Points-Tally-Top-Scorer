# ScoreSight — Predicting EPL Points Tally & Top Scorer

# Project Overview

ScoreSight is a machine learning project designed to predict English Premier League (EPL) match outcomes and player performance. By leveraging historical EPL data, the system forecasts match results, player goals, points tally, and top scorers. The project combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment in an interactive application, enabling real-time predictions.

# Objectives

Predict player performance (goals scored) using regression models.

Predict match outcomes (Win / Draw / Loss) using classification models.

Provide an interactive GUI for users to input match/player statistics and receive instant predictions.

Demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow from data handling to deployment.

# Features

Player Performance Prediction

Predict expected goals based on player statistics such as appearances, shots, passes, and assists.

Match Outcome Prediction

Predict whether a match will result in a Win, Draw, or Loss based on team performance statistics.

Interactive GUI

Built with Streamlit for a simple, user-friendly interface.

Model Integration

Random Forest Regression for goals prediction.

Gradient Boosting Classification for match outcome prediction.
