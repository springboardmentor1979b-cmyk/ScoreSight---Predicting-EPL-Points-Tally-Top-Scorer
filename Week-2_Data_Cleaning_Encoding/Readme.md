# Week 2 – Data Cleaning & Encoding

## Objective
The objective of Week 2 was to preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, selecting relevant features, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for machine learning models.

## Tasks Performed
- Identified important and irrelevant columns based on the project use case.
- Handled missing values in numerical columns by replacing them with mean values.
- Encoded categorical columns such as Club and Position using label encoding.
- Created a clean and machine-learning-ready dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

## Key Observations
- Missing values were present in performance-related columns.
- Encoding categorical features was necessary for model training.
- The dataset is now fully numerical and suitable for EDA and modeling.

## Conclusion
This week successfully transformed raw data into a clean and structured format, forming a strong foundation for exploratory data analysis and model training in upcoming weeks.
