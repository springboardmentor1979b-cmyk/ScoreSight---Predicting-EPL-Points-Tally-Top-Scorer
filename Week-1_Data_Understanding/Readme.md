# Week 1 – Data Understanding & Dataset Acquisition

## Objective
The objective of Week 1 was to understand the project goals and explore the dataset that will be used for predicting EPL match outcomes and player performance.

## Tasks Performed
- Downloaded the EPL dataset provided by the instructor.
- Loaded the dataset using Python and Pandas in Jupyter Notebook.
- Explored the structure of the dataset including rows, columns, and data types.
- Displayed sample records to understand player-related attributes.
- Performed basic queries to analyze goals, positions, clubs, and missing values.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

## Key Observations
- The dataset contains player-level performance data.
- Key columns include Goals, Assists, Position, Club, Appearances, and Age.
- Some columns contain missing values which will be handled in later weeks.

## Conclusion
This week helped in gaining a clear understanding of the dataset structure and identifying important features required for further preprocessing and model development.
