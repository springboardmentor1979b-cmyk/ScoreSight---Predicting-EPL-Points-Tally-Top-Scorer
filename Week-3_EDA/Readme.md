# Week 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
The objective of Week 3 was to perform exploratory data analysis to understand patterns, trends, and relationships between player attributes and performance metrics.

## Tasks Performed
- Analyzed goal distribution using histograms.
- Studied relationships between goals and appearances, age, shots, and assists using scatter plots.
- Compared club-wise total goals and position-wise average goals using bar charts.
- Visualized passing influence on assists.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

## Key Observations
- Players with higher appearances generally tend to score more goals.
- Shot count shows a positive correlation with goals.
- Certain positions have higher average goal contributions.
- Passing ability plays a significant role in assist generation.

## Conclusion
EDA provided valuable insights into player performance patterns and helped identify key features that will be useful for training predictive models in upcoming weeks.
