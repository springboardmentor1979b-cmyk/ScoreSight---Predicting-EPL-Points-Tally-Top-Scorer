# 📅 Week 3 – Feature Engineering & Scaling

## Objective

The objective of Week 3 was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between player attributes and performance metrics in the English Premier League dataset.

## Tasks Performed

* Analyzed goal distribution using **histograms**.
* Studied relationships between **goals** and **appearances, age, shots, and assists** using scatter plots.
* Compared **club-wise total goals** and **position-wise average goals** using bar charts.
* Visualized the impact of **passing ability** on assists.

## Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Key Observations

* Players with higher **appearances** generally score more goals.
* **Shot count** shows a positive correlation with goals scored.
* Certain **positions** (e.g., forwards) have higher average goal contributions.
* **Passing ability** significantly influences assist generation.

## Conclusion

Exploratory Data Analysis provided valuable insights into player performance patterns and identified key features that will be essential for training predictive models in the upcoming weeks.
